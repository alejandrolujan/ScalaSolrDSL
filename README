README

This project attempts to offer a simple Scala DSL to access many of Scala's Solr features.

It was build on purpose to read like JPA's API, such as:

MyModelClass.search(P.id between(10 and 12)).and(P.name eq "My Product")


This project is built on top of Solr4J, so it suffers from the limitations that library imposes.

Should you have any questions or suggestions, do contact me at andanthor@gmail.com

Cheers,

Alejandro.
