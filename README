OVERVIEW
--------

This project attempts to offer a simple Scala DSL to access many of Scala's Solr features.

It was build on purpose to read like JPA's API, such as:

MyModelClass.search(P.id between(10 and 12)).and(P.name eq "My Product")

This project is built on top of Solr4J, so it suffers from the limitations that library imposes.

HOW TO USE IT
-------------

For a quick test drive, follow these steps:

1. Setup your solr installation with the conf/schema.xml file (a simple, 3 field Product schema, look at lines 456-458)
2. Verify the app.config file and modify as needed
3. Run the TestSearch.scala file

This should give you a brief overview of how the DSL works, and verify your configuration is correct.
